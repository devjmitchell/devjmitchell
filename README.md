U.S. Marine veteran that started working in the tech world in 2013. Iâ€™ve held several leadership roles in the past, as well as multiple engineering jobs. Iâ€™ve collaborated with many teams, software engineers, and individuals focused on product vision. This has allowed me to become a better engineer and leader, with the ability to communicate and work effectively with others toward creating great products.
