Iâ€™m a U.S. Marine veteran that became a self-taught developer, starting in 2013. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and have attended multiple code camps, security conventions, and developer Meetup events. I even started my own Meetup group and co-host a podcast, both relating to iOS development and the Swift programming language.
