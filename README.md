I’m a U.S. Marine veteran that became a self-taught developer, starting in 2013. I’m always eager to learn new things and have attended multiple code camps, security conventions, and developer Meetup events. I even started my own Meetup group and co-host a podcast, both relating to iOS development and the Swift programming language.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping others. I follow news and updates related to iOS development and Swift... and yes, I have an app in the App Store.

You can find me on Twitter [@dev_jmitchell](https://twitter.com/dev_jmitchell "You should follow Jason on Twitter 😉") or check out my website <https://devjm.com>
